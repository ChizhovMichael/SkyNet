## Simple Vue app

A simple Vue.js application. Data for tariffs is received in json format from the server. Then this json is rendered into several tariffs, which are able to provide detailed information and the ability to display the page for choosing this tariff. The app is routed and uses the Vue.js router component. The frontend part also uses the Materialize framework.
